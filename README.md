Combining VR and Gamification to create a module for my Senior Capstone Thesis

This module is a self-contained unit of an introductory computer science topic. The module practices the programming concepts of Lists and present them in a gamified VR application. The purpose of this module is to test whether it can improve the academic performance of introductory computer science students. The module was developed using Unity's free VR software, the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Gaming System, and a Window's workstation.


I'm a complete novice at Unity, but this project was implemented/programed in 2 months. Regardless, here are a few things I did to set up my Unity environment and the Oculus Rift:

Oculus Rift Setup
- In the oculus box, there is a small pamphlet that tells you to go to this website to help you get started (Took about 40 minutes to       download) : https://www.oculus.com/setup/
- If you need to access the Oculus Rift support website go to: https://support.oculus.com/
- Note: I used a Windows Desktop as my workstation. During my setup, I realized that the sensors couldn't be connected to the USB 3         connection in the back of the computer due to a known Oculus issue. One work around for this is to connected it to the USB port in the     front of the computer tower. If you are connecting another USB into the front of the computer, make sure you don't use the oculus at the   same time because it may cause issues with the oculus connection.
- The oculus headset can be connected to the HDMI and USB 3 connection without issue.

Unity Environment Setup
- You can set up a free unity account and download the software from: https://store.unity.com/
- Once on the Unity main screen, create a new project and set it as 3D
- When the project loads go to: File > Build Settings > Player Settings > XR Settings. Once there set Virtual Reality Supported to on and   select Oculus.
- When starting you project you'll also need to go to: https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/unity/
- Download the following from the website above: 
  - Oculus Utilities for Unity
  - Oculus Avatar SDK
  - Oculus Platform SDK
- Once downloaded, drag their unity packages into the Assets folder in Unity and import them.
- A video explaining the above can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxvKGVDmYfY


The following Unity assets were used in my project:
  - Oculus Integration
  - VR Samples
  - Food & Grocery Items - Low Poly
  - Simple Shop Interiors - Cartoon assets
  - Character Pack: Free Sample
  - Free Voxel Girl (Dowloaded but ultimately not used)
  - NavMeshController
  - TextMesh Pro
